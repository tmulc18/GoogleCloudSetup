# Distributed TensorFlow

Boilerplate examples for help getting started with distributed computing in TensorFlow.  The official getting started guide is [here]( https://www.tensorflow.org/deploy/distributed).

The complete list of examples is below.  The asynchronous examples are *easier* than the synchronous, so people getting started should first have a complete understanding of those before moving to synchronous examples.


* Distributed setup on single-machine single-GPU
* Multiple-machine single-GPU
* Single-machine multiple-GPU
* Multiple-machine multiple-GPU
* Asychronous SGD (Downpour)
* Synchronous SGD
* Synchronous SGD variables learning rates
* ADAG (Aggregated Distributed Asynchronous Gradients)
* SDAG
